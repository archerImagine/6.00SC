## [Distribution ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBKxrPEeCSU&list=PLB2BE3D6CA77BB8F7&t=37) ##

We have 3 types of Distribution which we have talked about:-

1. Uniform Distribution
2. Normal Distribution
3. Exponential Distribution

### Uniform Distribution ###

A Uniform Distribution will look like this:-

The probability will be defined as `1/b-a`

We can plot two type of graph for uniform distribution, and there respective plots

1. Continuous Graph
2. Discrete Graph.

#### Continuous Graph ####

#### Discrete Graph ####

Both the graph looks a quite alike, the only difference being the value of `X` axis and `Y` axis.

### Normal Distribution ###

A Normal Distribution will look like this, we some empirical rules:-

A Normal Distribution have these property:-

* It always peeks at the mean.
* Falls of symmetrically.
* Normal Distribution can be nicely characterized by 2 parameters, **Mean** and **Standard Deviation**.

The function for normal distribution is denoted by:-

> The parameter ![](http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/7/2/b72bb92668acc30b4474caff40274044.png) in this definition is the mean or expectation of the distribution (and also its median and mode). The parameter ![](http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/d/4/9d43cb8bbcb702e9d5943de477f099e2.png) is its standard deviation; its variance is therefore ![](http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/c/6/3c6a93fc922fbfa19aea78961760cefb.png). A random variable with a Gaussian distribution is said to be normally distributed and is called a normal deviate.
